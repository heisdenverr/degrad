# degrad
Built on Vipy, degrad is a small auto gradient engine built for calculation of gradient up to n-dimension, buit off of Vipy allowed for calculation of n-dim grad, since Vipy is numpy like libary

## Appreciation
I had to understand karpathy autograd engine, to fully implement mine and  built it on Vipy libary which i created as a side project but still in development

## Use cases
git-clone Vipy, then git-clone degrad, because array fed into degrad must be a type Vipy object
